# Esolangs wiki
you can view the esolangs wiki page [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/YABFD)

# Thanks
this github repo [https://github.com/pocmo/Python-Brainfuck](https://github.com/pocmo/Python-Brainfuck)<br>
for having a good implentation of brainfuck in python which i modified to make this (also modified getch to be a single class)

# What is this Brainfuck Intepreter
well . . . it is a slightly modified version of brainfuck supporting
* If/If-Else statments
* Pointers to other memory locations
* diffrent memory banks (called `realms`) that can be switched between and provide a unique function in every realm

# How can I use this in my project
(now sure why you would want to do that but ...)
just copy the `YABFD` folder into your python function then
```python
import YABFD
```

# But what are all the commands
well just read [the docs](docs.md)
