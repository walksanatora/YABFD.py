(AKA Embedable BrainFuck)

well . . . it is a slightly modified version of brainfuck supporting
* If/If-Else statments
* Pointers to other memory locations
* diffrent memory banks (called `realms`) that can be switched between and provide a unique function in every realm

# How can I use this in my project
(now sure why you would want to do that but ...)
just copy the `YABFD` folder into your python function then
```python
import YABFD
